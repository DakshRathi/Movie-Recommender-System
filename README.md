# Movie-Recommender-System
This is content based recommender system.
Dataset used in this project was taken from kaggle tmdb_5000_movies.
Preprocessing was done on the dataset.
Text vectorization was done using bag of words.
Stemming was also done to to prevent simultaneous occurence of similar words.
Cosine distance between tags of each movie was calculated and based on that top 5 similar movies were displayed.
